                <p class="left">My interest in drawing and painting goes back as far as I can remember, sitting on the
                    floor of my father's cabinet shop, using pieces of discarded wood to paint trees. He was a wonderful
                    inspiration and encouraged that creativity throughout my life. That path has taken different
                    directions over the years, and my style of painting taken various turns; but in has always included
                    study and professional endeavors in the field of art and design.</p>

                <p class="left">As a painter, I have transitioned from the use of watercolor and realistic
                    interpretation to the abstract form of expression. It is a style I find more challenging – there is
                    nothing on a blank canvas, I have to find it. Always willing to explore different techniques and
                    develop a deeper understanding of what is important help keep the work alive and fresh. I strive to
                    project energy and motion with spontaneity, while maintaining a sense of balance and harmony –
                    working quickly is of great value and a technique that seems to require endless practice and
                    patience to achieve. Broad knives, squeegees and palette knives, which often take the place of
                    brushes, also contribute to the effect. I use a limited color palette, preferring to mix directly on
                    the canvas, giving a more vibrant result.</p>

                <p class="left">I hope to draw the viewer in – bringing them into a piece with their own sense of
                    creativity and self-expression – achieving another valuable goal, which is often elusive and
                    challenging.</p>
